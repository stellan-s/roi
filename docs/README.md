# ROI - Quantitative Trading System Documentation

## Overview

ROI is a sophisticated quantitative trading and investment analysis system written in Python. It combines Bayesian signal processing, regime detection, heavy-tail risk modeling, and portfolio management to generate actionable trading recommendations for Swedish and US stocks.

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular pipeline architecture with the following main components:

## Key Features

### ðŸ§  Bayesian Signal Engine
- **Probabilistic Decision Making**: Combines multiple signals using Bayesian inference
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provides confidence intervals and uncertainty measures
- **Adaptive Learning**: Updates beliefs based on market performance
- **Multi-signal Integration**: Trend, momentum, and sentiment analysis

### ðŸ“Š Regime Detection
- **Market Context Awareness**: Classifies markets as Bull, Bear, or Neutral
- **HMM-based Classification**: Hidden Markov Models for regime transition
- **Signal Adaptation**: Adjusts signal weights based on market regime
- **Risk-aware Positioning**: Different allocation strategies per regime

### ðŸ“ˆ Heavy-tail Risk Modeling
- **Student-t Distributions**: Realistic modeling of fat-tail events
- **Extreme Value Theory (EVT)**: Tail risk quantification
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: 12-month probability scenarios
- **Stress Testing**: Portfolio resilience under extreme conditions

### ðŸ’¼ Portfolio Management
- **Risk Budgeting**: Position sizing based on risk-adjusted returns
- **Regime Diversification**: Prevents over-concentration in single regime
- **Transaction Cost Optimization**: Filters out unprofitable trades
- **Dynamic Rebalancing**: Continuous portfolio optimization
