## 1. Portfolio Diversification Improvements

### Configuration Location
```yaml
# quant/config/settings.yaml
risk_budgeting:
  max_position_weight: 0.06          # Reduced from 0.10
  max_factor_concentration: 0.20     # Reduced from 0.25
  min_positions: 12                  # Increased from 8
  max_positions: 25                  # Increased from 20
```

### Key Changes
- **Maximum position size reduced** from 10% to 6% for better diversification
- **Minimum positions increased** from 8 to 12 for broader diversification
- **Factor concentration limits** tightened to prevent sector over-concentration
- **Portfolio capacity increased** to 25 positions for opportunity capture

### Expected Benefits

## 2. Volatility-Based Position Sizing

### Configuration Location
```yaml
risk_budgeting:
