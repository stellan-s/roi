# Recent System Fixes and Improvements

This document describes critical fixes implemented to resolve system issues and improve reliability.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Network Timeout Hangs (CRITICAL FIX)

**Problem**: The daily analysis would hang indefinitely when fetching price data from yfinance or news data from RSS feeds.

**Root Cause**: Network calls using `signal.alarm()` for timeouts don't work reliably on macOS, causing indefinite blocking.

**Solution**: Implemented thread-based timeouts using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` in both data fetching modules.

**Files Modified**:
- `quant/data_layer/prices.py:71-79`
- `quant/data_layer/news.py:45-53`

**Code Change**:
```python
# OLD: Signal-based timeout (unreliable on macOS)
signal.alarm(timeout_seconds)
data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, auto_adjust=True, progress=False)

# NEW: Thread-based timeout (reliable)
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    future = executor.submit(yf.download, ticker, start=start_date, auto_adjust=True, progress=False)
    data = future.result(timeout=timeout_seconds)
```

### 2. Contradictory Trading Recommendations (CRITICAL FIX)

**Problem**: Stocks with positive expected returns were being marked for "Sell", creating logically contradictory recommendations.

**Root Cause**: Faulty OR logic in sell decision criteria allowed selling based on low probability alone, ignoring positive expected returns.

**Solution**: Changed to AND logic requiring both low probability AND negative expected return for sell decisions.

**Files Modified**:
- `quant/bayesian/integration.py:175-177`

**Code Change**:
```python
# OLD: Contradictory OR logic
elif (output.prob_positive <= sell_threshold or
      (output.expected_return <= -min_expected_return and
       output.uncertainty <= max_uncertainty)):

# NEW: Logical AND requirement
elif (output.prob_positive <= sell_threshold and
      output.expected_return <= -min_expected_return and
      output.uncertainty <= max_uncertainty):
```

### 3. Future Date Leak in Backtesting (DATA INTEGRITY FIX)

**Problem**: Backtesting was using hardcoded future dates, creating unrealistic performance metrics.

**Root Cause**: Hardcoded end date "2025-09-16" was in the future relative to historical analysis.

**Solution**: Implemented dynamic date calculation relative to current date.

**Files Modified**:
- `quant/backtest_runner.py:32-33`

**Code Change**:
```python
# OLD: Hardcoded future dates
end_date = "2025-09-16"  # Future date!
start_date = "2025-03-19"

# NEW: Dynamic date calculation
today = datetime.now().date()
end_date = (today - timedelta(days=1)).isoformat()
start_date = (today - timedelta(days=180)).isoformat()
```

### 4. Fake Regime Consensus (REPORTING FIX)

**Problem**: All stocks showed identical regime classification, creating artificial "100% consensus" reports.

**Root Cause**: Global regime assignment instead of per-stock regime detection.

**Solution**: Implemented individual stock regime detection with honest distribution reporting.

**Files Modified**:
- `quant/bayesian/integration.py:73-98`
- `quant/policy_engine/rules.py:80-95`

**Key Changes**:
- Per-stock regime detection using individual price histories
- Column name compatibility (`market_regime` vs `regime`)
- Honest distribution reporting instead of fake consensus

### 5. Updated Decision Thresholds (CALIBRATION FIX)

**Problem**: Decision thresholds were too restrictive, causing minimal trading activity.

**Root Cause**: Conservative thresholds calibrated for different market conditions.

**Solution**: Updated thresholds based on system testing and performance analysis.

**Files Modified**:
- `quant/config/settings.yaml`

**Updated Thresholds**:
```yaml
# OLD thresholds
buy_probability: 0.58
sell_probability: 0.40
min_expected_return: 0.0005
max_uncertainty: 0.35

# NEW thresholds (more balanced)
buy_probability: 0.55
sell_probability: 0.45
min_expected_return: 0.0002
max_uncertainty: 0.50
```

## System Status

### âœ… Confirmed Working
- Network data fetching with reliable timeouts
- Logical trading recommendations (no contradictions)
- Proper backtesting with historical dates
- Per-stock regime detection
- Realistic performance metrics

### ðŸ”§ Key Improvements
- **Reliability**: System no longer hangs on network issues
- **Logic**: Trading decisions are now mathematically consistent
- **Accuracy**: Backtesting uses proper historical data
- **Honesty**: Regime reporting shows actual distribution
- **Balance**: Decision thresholds allow reasonable trading activity

## Running the System

After these fixes, the system can be run reliably:

```bash
# Standard pipeline (with fixes)
python -m quant.main

# Adaptive pipeline (recommended)
python -m quant.adaptive_main

# Backtesting (now with proper dates)
python -m quant.backtest_runner
```

## Future Monitoring

Watch for these potential issues:
1. **Network timeouts**: Monitor for any hanging behavior in data fetching
2. **Trading logic**: Verify that buy/sell recommendations make logical sense
3. **Regime detection**: Ensure regime distributions look realistic
4. **Performance metrics**: Check that backtesting results are reasonable

## Impact on Documentation

These fixes have been reflected in updated documentation:
- Configuration thresholds updated
- Decision logic clarified
- System requirements updated (Python 3.12, additional dependencies)
- Backtesting behavior corrected

All documentation now reflects the current working state of the system.
